1. Nowadays, vehicles are most important part of human life. We can’t even imagine life without vehicles. We know that, road accident is one of the serious problems we are facing. One of the major reasons of these accidents is rash and inefficient driving. So, it is very important to monitor the driving skills of the driver. If we will be able to monitor whether the driver is driving the car correctly or not & also to generate a report based on the driving skills of the driver, we will be able
to evaluate driver’s performance & also notify the driver using GUI console if rash driving is detected. This in turn will reduce the accidents due to rash driving. 

2. Also, the rash driving of cars affects the car performance such as reduction in fuel economy, reduction in the performance of engine, wearing & burning of
some mechanical parts in some cases, etc.

3. Thus,the main aim of this project is to implement a system which will monitor the driver performance & will generate a report depending upon the driving skills of the driver. 

4. Rash driving detection will be based upon certain parameters such as speeding the car more than rated speed, accelerating the car more than its respective gear limits, taking inappropriate turns, etc. Also, if car is driven efficiently within certain limits, it will also in turn increase the car performance along with reduction in number of accidents.
